# Album Art Generator
This is the project I made to learn Django and ReactJS.
It generates interesting images by layering random images that are fetched by custom search term from www.unsplash.com, a great website for free creative commons photos.

Uses bootstrap4 for various css styling. Includes firerobot image editor: https://scaleflex.github.io/filerobot-image-editor/

Since the API is doing image processing on a free heroku server, it can be slow to load. Give it 10-30 seconds.
